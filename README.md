# Recommendation System
This repository contains a Python script for building a recommendation system using collaborative filtering with cosine similarity.

## Overview
The script generates a synthetic user-item interaction matrix and uses cosine similarity to find similar users, recommending unrated items based on their preferences.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Installation
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Run the script to generate recommendations:
```bash
python recommendation_system.py
```

## Output
- List of recommended item indices for a sample user

## Note
Replace synthetic data with real user-item interaction data for practical use.
